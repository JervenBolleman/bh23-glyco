# Future work

## Annotating entries in PubChem that contain glycans

## Integration of variant data into GlyCosmos


## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank the fellow participants at BioHackathon 2023 for their collaboration and constructive advice, which greatly influenced our project. We are grateful to the organizers for providing this platform and the developers of open source language models. Special thanks to our mentors, advisors, and colleagues for their guidance and support. Without their contributions, our project in linked data standardization with LLMs in bioinformatics would not have been possible.
